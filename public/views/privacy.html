        <h1>ValTools Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to ValTools, a free Twitch extension designed to connect streamers with their community by displaying essential Valorant profile data. We take your privacy seriously, and this policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            ValTools does not store any sensitive personal information. The data we handle includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Riot name, tag, and puuid (Player Universally Unique IDentifiers).</li>
            <li>Basic profile information such as player card, rank, and match history (agent, score, and personal stats like KDA and ACS).</li>
            <li>Technical data such as IP address, browser type, and device information for security and optimization purposes.</li>
            <li>We do not collect any sensitive data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>
            The data collected is used solely to display information on the Twitch extension and improve your experience with ValTools. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Displaying Valorant profile information in an interactive overlay.</li>
            <li>Providing real-time updates on match history and player performance.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the security and integrity of the service by monitoring technical data.</li>
            <li>We store data in an end-to-end encrypted MongoDB database and Redis cache server.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            ValTools connects to Riot's official API and other Third Party APIs to collect and display relevant data. We do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes. However, we may share information with:
        </p>

            <li>Service providers necessary for hosting and maintaining ValTools.</li>
            <li>Authorities, if required by law or to protect our rights and users' safety.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Security and Data Protection</h2>
        <p>
            ValTools uses <span class="important">JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</span> to secure your data. This ensures that only individuals using the extension have access to the information, protecting it from unauthorized third-party access. Additionally, streamers can choose to hide their match history if they prefer.
        </p>

        <h2>5. User Rights and Choices</h2>

        <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
            Your data may be transferred to servers located outside your country of residence. We take appropriate safeguards to ensure your data is protected in compliance with relevant laws.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Automated Decision-Making</h2>
        <p>
            ValTools does not use automated decision-making processes or profiling that could significantly impact users.
        </p>
