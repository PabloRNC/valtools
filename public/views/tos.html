        <h1>ValTools Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to ValTools! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the ValTools Twitch extension. By using ValTools, you agree to these Terms, so please read them carefully.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
        <p>
            ValTools is a free Twitch extension designed to display Valorant profile data during a stream. By using ValTools, you agree to use the service for its intended purpose and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
        </p>

        <h2>2. User Accounts and Authentication</h2>
        <p>
            With ValTools, streamers must securely link their Valorant account to the extension via the <span class="important">RSO (Riot Sign-On)</span> system. This ensures that only the authorized streamer can connect their Valorant profile. No manual input of username or tag is required.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Content Displayed</h2>
        <p>
            ValTools displays information from your Valorant profile, such as your username, rank, match history, and in-game statistics. By using ValTools, you agree to allow this data to be displayed on your Twitch stream through the extension. You may have the option to hide certain data, like your match history, if you choose.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>
            While we strive to keep ValTools up and running, we cannot guarantee that the service will always be available or error-free. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue ValTools at any time without prior notice.
        </p>

        <h2>5. API Usage</h2>
        <p>
            ValTools connects to Riot's official API and other Third Part API's to collect and display relevant data from your Valorant account. By using the extension, you agree to the use of this API to fetch and display the necessary information.
        </p>

        <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
            As a user of ValTools, you are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring the security of your Riot and Twitch accounts.</li>
            <li>Using the extension in a lawful manner and for its intended purpose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            ValTools is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. To the fullest extent permitted by law, ValTools and its developers are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the extension.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Modifications to Terms</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and by continuing to use ValTools, you accept those changes.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the service is provided. Any disputes arising from these Terms or the use of ValTools will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction.
